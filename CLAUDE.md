## Key Component Details

### DashboardPage.jsx (Main Implementation)
- **State Management**: Uses React hooks for teams, services, search, date ranges
- **Data Flow**: Loads data from API, applies filters, updates all visualizations
- **Filter Integration**: Multi-select dropdowns, search, and saved views
- **Real-time Updates**: All charts and KPIs respond to filter changes instantly

### Layout.jsx (Navigation)
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible with mobile responsiveness
- **React Router Links**: Active state management with useLocation hook
- **Professional Header**: Shows current page and user avatar placeholder

### Multi-Select Components**
- **MultiSelectFilter.jsx**: Dropdown with search, checkboxes, select all
- **QuickSearch.jsx**: Search bar with suggestions and categories
- **SavedViews.jsx**: Save/load filter combinations with localStorage

### Chart Components
- **Professional styling** with gradients and animations
- **Responsive behavior** that adapts to container size
- **Interactive tooltips** with formatted currency display
- **Chart.js integration** with proper component registration

## Current Data Flow

1. **API Integration**: DashboardPage loads teams and cost data from Spring Boot backend
2. **State Management**: React hooks manage selected teams, services, search terms, dates
3. **Filtering Logic**: useEffect hooks filter cost data based on current selections
4. **Visualization Updates**: Filtered data flows to all charts, KPIs, and tables
5. **Persistence**: SavedViews component stores filter combinations in localStorage

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start full stack
docker-compose up --build

# Access application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:8080
```

### Recent Changes Made
- Fixed Chart.js registration issues by creating `chartSetup.js`
- Added comprehensive color system in `colors.js`
- Implemented multi-select filtering with real-time updates
- Created professional KPI dashboard with trend analysis
- Added React Router navigation with active states
- Implemented saved views with localStorage persistence

### Build Status
- âœ… Frontend builds successfully with Chart.js integration
- âœ… All components render without errors
- âœ… Navigation works across all pages
- âœ… Filtering and search functionality operational
- âœ… Mobile responsive design confirmed

## Roadmap Status

### Completed (Phase 1 - 100%)
- Modern dashboard design with professional UI
- Chart.js data visualization with animations
- Advanced filtering with multi-select and search
- KPI dashboard with 6 key metrics
- Multi-page navigation with React Router

### Next Priorities (Phase 2 - Q4 2025)
- **Phase 2.1**: Budget Management (budgets, forecasting, alerts)
- **Phase 2.2**: Cost Optimization (recommendations, right-sizing)
- **Phase 2.3**: Reporting & Analytics (custom reports, exports)

### Remaining from Phase 1 (Optional)
- Additional group-by dimensions (service, region, resource type)
- CSV export functionality  
- Cost type toggle (actual vs amortized)

## Important Files for Context Restoration

### Critical React Components
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx` - Main dashboard with all filtering
- `src/components/Layout.jsx` - Navigation and routing
- `src/components/MultiSelectFilter.jsx` - Advanced filtering
- `src/components/KPIDashboard.jsx` - Professional metrics
- `src/App.js` - React Router setup

### Configuration Files
- `src/config/chartSetup.js` - Chart.js component registration
- `src/config/chartConfig.js` - Professional chart styling
- `src/styles/colors.js` - AWS/Azure color system
- `src/styles/typography.js` - Typography system

### Documentation
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Updated project roadmap with Phase 1 completion
- `README.md` - Project overview (needs updating with Phase 1 achievements)
- `frontend/README.md` - Frontend-specific documentation (needs updating)

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Technical Debt
- Some ESLint warnings remain (missing dependencies in useEffect)
- Unused import in DashboardPage.jsx (getInputStyle)
- Could benefit from TypeScript migration for better type safety

### Performance Optimizations
- Consider React.memo for expensive components
- Implement virtualization for large data sets
- Add loading states for better UX

### Future Enhancements
- Error boundaries for better error handling
- Unit tests for key components
- Storybook for component documentation
- PWA features for offline usage
